          <h1>The Cube Case Study</h1>

            education.”</p>

          <h3>About The Cube</h3>
          <p class="content-paragraph">The Cube, formerly known as the MSU DCPC (Digital & Community Publishing Collective) is directed by Dr. Kate Birdsall, a Writing, Rhetoric, & American Cultures (WRAC) faculty member at Michigan State. The
            mission of The Cube is "Publishing - Process - Praxis" that aims to provide resources and support for a wide range of MSU and community based publications. The Cube currently supports the work of seven different WRAC faculty members, and
            hopes to attract more publishers outside of Michigan State. The overall purpose is to provide a platform for publishers to become better recognized and share their work.</p>
          <h3 class="work-headings">Summary</h3>
          <p class="content-paragraph">The improvements we made to The Cube website formerly known as MSU DCPC provided solutions to problems we identified, while creating an overall better user experience. Our primary goal was to create a foundation
            to provide resources for a wide range of publishers.</p>

          <h3 class="work-headings">Our challenge</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Identify The Cube's mission and undergo a rebrand process.</li>

            <li class="content-paragraph">Improve the information architecture and site organization.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="work-headings">Approaching the challenge</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Conducted research to better identify who The Cube is in order to create a new logo and style guide.</li>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Performed user research to discover problems users encountered with the website.</li>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Designed and tested new features that address problems the users faced, along with establishing publishers as clients.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="work-headings">Understanding The Cube</h3>
          <p class="content-paragraph">The design team needed to figure out what the identity of The Cube was to begin the rebrand process, then perform research with the owners and users of the website to identify problems.</p>
          <h4>The original website home page:</h4>
          <img src="/img/thecube/home.jpg" alt="the cube original homepage">
          <p class="content-paragrph">The home page essentially lacked any information and only provided the user with a name and hamburger menu which didn't make sense for desktop usage. We sought out to completely redesign the homepage and give the user some context into what they are using.</p>
          <h3 class="work-headings">Research methods:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Used Jakob Nielson's usability heuristics for interface design to identify usability issues that we would address with the fresh design. This helped form our ideas for the new brand and interface.</li>
            <li class="content-paragraph">1 on 1 interviews with organization owners and users.</li>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Usability testing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>The main problems we discovered:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Users felt lost when first accessing the site with no call to action and little information.</li>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Elements across the website lacked functionality.</li>
            <li class="content-paragraph">Website pages lacked information which caused some users to become confused about what they were looking at.</li>
            <li class="content-paragraph">No place for publishers to contact the organization.</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          <h3 class="work-headings">Defining the new Cube</h3>
          <p class="content-paragraph">With research completed and out of the way, we created a style guide that represented The Cube with a new brand, and narrowed down what users wanted from this website. All of the design elements (color, type, etc.) were left up to the team to decide, and we chose to use a green color scheme that represents the connection the Cube has with MSU, though not to the point where they are completely under the MSU umbrella.</p>

          <h3 class="work-headings">Ideate</h3>
          <p class="content-paragraph">With the style guide and user insights in hand, we went forward with developing lo-fi wireframes for the website.</p>

          <h3 class="work-headings">Prototyping the Cube experience</h3>
          <p class="content-paragraph">After completing lo-fi sketches of the website layout, we began designing a hi-fi mockup and prototype of the website. Our final deliverables for The Cube were an interactive prototype and a style guide with new branding.

            <img src="/img/thecube/hifipages.jpg" alt="hi-fi mockup of the cube website">
            <p class="content-paragraph">With this mockup and prototype, the following problems we identified in the research process were addressed:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="content-paragraph">Solved issues with the user interface that were identified by the heuristic analysis by making changes and adding features to the user interface.</li>
              <li class="content-paragraph">Users before had felt lost when entering the website so introducing a navigation bar, call to action button, and an about statement all provided the user with information about where to go and the purpose
                of the website.</li>
              <li class="content-paragraph">Non-functioning elements such as links and close buttons were addressed and now are functional for the user. This will limit errors the user encounters while interacting with the website.</li>
              <li class="content-paragraph">To treat the publishers as clients, we implemented a "Partner with us" button which will allow publishers to apply to become featured on the website and have a platform to spread out their work.</li>
              <li class="content-paragraph">The overall user interface was redesigned to become more asthetically pleasing and usable for users.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="work-headings">Validation</h3>
            <p class="content-paragraph">Once all the tasks were completed we combined the deliverables into a presentation that was shown to the client. The presentation was a major success given that this was our first client based UX project and
              the client was impressed by
              what
              we presented. The Cube is now working on implementing these features and designs to their new website that will overall enhance the user experience and provide a platform for new and current publishers.</p>

            <h3 class="work-headings">Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ol>
              <li class="content-paragraph">Communication within a team is crucial when taking on any type of project. Working as a team to develop a timeline and assign tasks was important for keeping the team well organized and on track to meet our
                goals. Communicating our
                ideas
                and concerns proved beneficial in refining our research and design techniques, which led to an overall successful project.</li>
              <li class="content-paragraph">Asking questions is one of the best things a researcher and designer can do. Not being afraid to ask the right questions helped the team identify clear goals and form a path to get there. Asking questions
                also limited confusion that
                seems
                to be an issue on many teams.</li>
              <li class="content-paragraph">Sometimes when you're stuck and don't know the next move, taking lead can get the team through those obstacles and continue forward to meet the goals. In taking a leadership role, I was able to keep our
                team optimistic, focused, and
                confident throughout the process.</li>
